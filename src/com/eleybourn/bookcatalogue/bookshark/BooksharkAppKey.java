 * NOTE: The project must include a class, BooksharkAppKey in this folder, which contains a
 * single static String, KEY, containing the app key granted by Bookshark. For testing purposes
 * this KEY can be junk.

 * If you need to test the app, and do not have an Bookshark App Key, just use this file.
